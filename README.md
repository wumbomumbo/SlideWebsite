## Slide Website, written in PHP.

This is a pretty old project of mine that was to help me learn more about PHP, HTML, CSS, and JS. 
The code will be pretty ugly in some parts, and the way its setup is not the best, but it works.
The code has not been consistently updated for at least a year as from writing this, so it's not gonna be very secure, I don't recommend using this in its current state publicly.
The SQL database has also been lost, you will have to recreate it from scratch, but it wont be very hard to do.
